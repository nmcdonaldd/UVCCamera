How to compile library  
=========
If you want to compile this library(on command line),
 1. move to libUVCCamera directory
 2. run ndk-build clean
 3. run ndk-build

(tested NDK-r9d/NDK-r10c 64bit on OSX)  
The libraries are saved into libs/`architecture name` directory, for example libs/armeabi-v7a
Only library for armeabi-v7a architecture is compiled with the default setting.
If you want to compile for other architecture, you need change APP_ABI flag in the
library/jni/Application.mk file.

After compiling, copy or move libuvc.so and libUVCCamera.so into your project's 
libs/`architecture name` folder.

Or  
You can use `libUVCCamera` as a library project. Please import all files under `libUVCCamera`
directory into your IDE.  

All files and directories under `library` directory is deprecated.

libusb and libjpeg are embeddedã€€into libuvc.so with current setting. You can also compile to
separate shared libraries but some compile/link error may occur(we have not confirmed well yet). 

How to use
=========
These sample projects are Eclipse project. Please import using Eclipse. I will be porting Android Studio projects soon.
This library works on at least Android 3.1 or later(API >= 12), but Android 4.0(API >= 14)
or later is better. USB host function must be required.
If you want to try on Android 3.1, you will need some modification(need to remove 
setPreviewTexture method in UVCCamera.java etc.), but we have not confirm whether the sample
project run on Android 3.1 yet. Make sure to change [this line](https://github.com/nmcdonaldd/UVCCamera/blob/master/libUVCCamera/jni/UVCCamera/serenegiant_usb_UVCCamera.cpp#L223) & [this line](https://github.com/nmcdonaldd/UVCCamera/blob/master/libUVCCamera/jni/UVCCamera/serenegiant_usb_UVCCamera.cpp#L231) to match your project structure.
Some sample projects need API>=18 though.

###2014/07/25
Add some modification to the library and new sample project named "USBCameraTest2".
This new sample project demonstrate how to capture movie using frame data from
UVC camera with MediaCodec and MediaMuxer.
New sample requires at least Android 4.3(API>=18).
This limitation does not come from the library itself but from the limitation of 
MediaMuxer and MediaCodec#createInputSurface.

###2014/09/01
Add new sample project named `USBCameraTest3`
This new sample project demonstrate how to capture audio and movie simultaneously
using frame data from UVC camera and internal mic with MediaCodec and MediaMuxer.
This new sample includes still image capturing as png file.(you can easily change to
save as jpeg) This sample also requires at least Android 4.3(API>=18).
This limitation does not come from the library itself but from the limitation of 
MediaMuxer and MediaCodec#createInputSurface.

###2014/11/16
Add new sample project named `USBCameraTest4`
This new sample project mainly demonstrate how to use offscreen rendering
and record movie without any display.
The communication with camera execute as Service and continue working
even if you stop app. If you stop camera communication, click "stop service" button.

###2014/12/17
Add bulk transfer mode and update sample projects.

###2015/01/12
Add wiki page, [HowTo](https://github.com/saki4510t/UVCCamera/wiki/howto "HowTo")

###2015/01/22
Add method to adjust preview resolution and frame data mode.

###2015/02/12
Add IFrameCallback interface to get frame data as ByteArray
and new sample project `USBCameraTest5` to demonstrate how to use the callback method.

###2015/02/18
Add `libUVCCamera` as a library project(source code is almost same as previous release except Android.mk).
All files and directories under `library` directory is deprecated.

###2015/05/25
libraryProject branch merged to master.

###2015/05/30
Fixed the issue that DeviceFilter class could not work well when providing venderID, productID etc.

###2015/06/03
Add new sample project named `USBCameraTest6`
This new sample project mainly demonstrate how to show video images on two TextureView simultaneously, side by side.

###2015/06/10
Fixed the issue of pixel format is wrong when NV21 mode on calling IFrameCallback#onFrame(U and V plane was swapped) and added YUV420SP mode.

###2015/06/11
Improve the issue of `USBCameraTest4` that fails to connect/disconnect.
